    description: `On a trip to l'ile de ré with my family during summer I decided to take a picture of the sea with my camera.
    I'm always looking for nice things to capture using my camera and this time I had a little idea.
    I decided to hold my phone as I was taking my picture to make it seem like we could see through my phone (thus the title inspiration).
    These kind of picture are obviously irrealistic and fake, so once the picture was taken I had to go on photoshop to do the actual montage.
    I don't usually use photoshop or do montage like that but I like this picture even though the montage is kinda off if you look closely.
    It was a nice try anyways :)
